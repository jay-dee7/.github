:wave: Hey! I'm a DevOps Egineer working [@vetted](https://github.com/Vetted) trying *NOT* to break too many things in one go. I primarily work on Go, Terraform, Ansible, Containers and Container Orchestration, CI/CD Pipelines and a bunch of AWS Services. I've also worked on frontend and backend services in the past, primarily on ReactJS and PostgreSQL.

## Goals For 2020
*Even though 2020 has a potential to be the worst year of all time, i'm trying to be optimistic.*

* Read More Books (currenlty i'm reading [Building Secure And Reliable Systems](https://landing.google.com/sre/resources/foundationsandprinciples/srs-book/))
* contribute to more open source projects
* Learn better concurrency patterns
* Nail Distributed Systems
* Learn eBPF (but maybe in 2021)


```go
package main

func main() {
  panic("just about everything")
}
```
